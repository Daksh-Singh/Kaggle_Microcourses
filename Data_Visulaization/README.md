This course contains some basic plotting techniques using seaborn library of python for plotting the graph, namely Line chart, Bargraph, Heatmaps, Histograms and Density plots(1-D and 2-D KDE's).

All the various plotting techinques with their examples are described in the notebook, additionally comments are also added to help the reader to understand various plotting techniques.
All the example data is given along with the notebook, but you can run the notebook locally with your own data.



Changes you have to made while using your own dataset:

1.You have to change the address of the file(csv file) according to the location of dataset file you are using, I'm storing the data in the same folder that store notebook also.

2.Rename the variables according to your need and understanding.

Some of the plot are shown below:
